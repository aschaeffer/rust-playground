# About Rust

## 1. Why Rust?

* Rust is fast (is build to replace C++)
  * Targets to performance critical applications
* Memory Safety
  * 70% of high voluntarily bugs due to memory
  * Powerful type system and ownership model
  * Thread safety
  * Memory bugs are elimiated at compile time (!)
  * In contrast to languages running in a virtual machine: no performance costs
* Cross Platform
  * Run at linux, mac, win
* Concurrency
  * Compiler prevents basic concurrency mistakes
* Scope
  * High Performance
  * Embedded Systems
  * Desktop
  * Server
  * Web (web assembly)
* Produces a static binary

## 2. Cons

* Steep learing curve
* The Go compiler is faster
* Smaller ecosystem (less libraries)

## 3. When Rust?

* When you need efficiency and performance
* When you need non-vulnerable software
